# Day 4 - 3.4


## Topic of toyday - Internal APIs and developer portals
First half of the day was spent on research, watching more videos and reading up on other people's presentations. 

API the docs conference was interesting and I looked through all presentations from [2020](https://pronovix.com/event/api-docs-virtual-2020) and [2021](https://pronovix.com/event/api-docs-virtual-2021).

The presentation "Internal Developer Portals: Developer Engagement Behind the Firewall"  by [Kristof Van Tomme](https://twitter.com/kvantomme) resonated with me and made me realize the needs for an internal API and its developer portal by both API consumers and API producers are different than those for the APIs of an internet native company.

Therefore, I pivoted a bit on the deliverable to focus on the needs of API consumers and API producers related to internal APIs and their developer portal.

## Time schedule
Today, I've spread the work more even across the full day from 8-21 with long breaks and "free time" in between. The experience has been good, but it has been important to stop the watching video presentations research as it wears down my energy.
