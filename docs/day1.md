# Day 1 - 31.05
The first day has been productive and the absence of disturbances has had a significant impact on focus.

## Topic of toyday - Smart contract
The topic of today has been [Smart contracts](https://elsewhat.com/thinkweek-dparnas-2021/smart-contracts/). I've been able to dig deep down into the core in order to get a good understanding. Particularly, doing a [code review of an example ERC721 contract](https://elsewhat.com/thinkweek-dparnas-2021/smart-contracts/erc-721-example/) has helped my understanding. 

There are still some remaining topics within this area I plan to cover on day 2.

## Office setup
The office setup has worked very well. I brought a ultrawide monitor and setup in the living room of the cabin. I've also brought a small whiteboard (1mx1.5m) for structuring thoughts.

## Tools 
The toolchain setup for structuring and publishing my notes has worked very well and it has been important that this was prepared in advance. The tool chain consist of a github repo with notes in markdown. On every commit, a github action is triggered which runs mkdocs and publishes the content to [https://elsewhat.com/thinkweek-dparnas-2021/](https://elsewhat.com/thinkweek-dparnas-2021/)

## Time schedule
The day started at 07:30 before breakfast and has typically had a 1 time focus slot followed by a break. 
Approximately once every two hours, I've gone outside for short walk to clearing my head.
