# Day 1 - 1.4


## Topic of toyday - Shifting
The topic of day 2 was a bit less structured than day 1. As the results for day 1 was active in my head, I decided to continue down that path for a second final day. 

The first half on was spent on:

1. Summarizing day 1
2. Investigating level 2 blockchains and how they could interact with the main Ethereum blockchain. 
3. Brainstorming about smart contracts of everyday life in Norway

In order to do the brainstorming about smart contracts of everyday life, I did a structuring of various of existing usage of smart contracts.

I then decided this structuring of existing usage was a excellent deliverable from this day and made this available in the [Smart contract usage section](https://elsewhat.com/thinkweek-dparnas-2021/smart-contract-usage/)

## Time schedule
Today, I've overextended and underestimate the work load required so it was a quite taxing day. 
For the next day two days I'll focusing on World class APIs and will use the first day for research and structuring the deliverables.

Had a some walks in the alpine slope here and there are still some patches of snow
