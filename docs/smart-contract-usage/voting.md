Smart contract can define governance models for organisations such as Gitcoin, FlamingoDAO and MeebitsDAO.


## GitCoin
"Open source software is the foundation for coordination tools that will help humanity solve our toughest challenges. However, despite $500B+ in yearly economic output, developers have traditionally had no means to pay their rent while working on open source projects.

This is why we built Gitcoin: A platform to fund builders looking for meaningful, open source work. We’ve pioneered Quadratic Funding, a novel, democratic way to fund public goods in our quarterly Gitcoin Grants rounds. Since its launch in November 2017, Gitcoin Grants has now provided nearly $16M of funding to public goods." - from [Introducing GTC – Gitcoin’s Governance Token](https://gitcoin.co/blog/introducing-gtc-gitcoins-governance-token/)

[Smart contract is available](https://etherscan.io/address/0xde30da39c46104798bb5aa3fe8b9e0e1f348163f#code) via etherscan.

### FlamingoDAO
"Flamingo is an NFT-focused DAO that aims to explore emerging investment opportunities for ownable, blockchain-based assets. NFTs are not just cat pictures. They encompass digital art, collectibles, and in-game assets and other tangible assets. These new forms of digital property are poised to play an increasing role in helping to create, monetize, and incentivize online digital content.

How do members vote?
Members will be prompted to vote via Flamingo DApp (or, over time, other online services) at various points during the lifecycle of Flamingo, including to evaluate purchase decisions, weigh-in on the structure and form of Flamingo, and/or other strategic decisions related to Flamingo.

Voting will be facilitated by blockchain-based smart contracts and via the DApp based on ownership records maintained on the Ethereum blockchain." -- from [FlamingoDAOs website](https://docs.flamingodao.xyz/)

### MeebitsDAO
"In our virtual government: 1 Meebit gets 1 Vote
This will be managed by NFTs issued as Voting Seats which are exchangeable 1:1 with a Meebit.
Voting seats are owned by actual people, of course, initially open to 200 Founder Representatives, each of whom may obtain up to 20 Voting Seats (NFTs)." - from [MeebitsDAO: How Voting Works](https://medium.com/meebitsdao/meebitsdao-how-voting-works-91cdd2b882be)
