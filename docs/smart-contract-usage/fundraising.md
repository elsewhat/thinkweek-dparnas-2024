## Save Thousands of Lives - NooraHealth
"We will use the proceeds from the sale of this NFT to save lives. We estimate that with each $1,235 raised by selling it, we can save one life (and improve several more).

At Noora Health, we train patientsâ€™ families to take care of them after they leave the hospital. We work primarily with new mothers and their families in South Asia, where we are running programs in 165 hospitals. The data we've collected since October 2018 suggests we can save 9 babies per 1000 live births, at a cost of $1,235 per life saved." -from [OpenSea listing](https://opensea.io/assets/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/96773753706640817147890456629920587151705670001482122310561805592519359070209)
