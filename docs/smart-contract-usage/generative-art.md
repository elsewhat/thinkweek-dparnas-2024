# Generative art

## Autoglyphs - 2019?
Significance: Artwork lives on blockchain, from makers of CryptoPunks  
Editions: 512  
"Autoglyphs are the first “on-chain” generative art on the Ethereum blockchain. They are a completely self-contained mechanism for the creation and ownership of an artwork.
Autoglyphs are an experiment in generative art, each one unique and created by code running on the Ethereum blockchain. A glyph can be created by anyone who is willing to donate the creation fee of 0.20Ξ ($514) to our chosen charity, 350.org. The creator of the glyph will then also become the first owner of the glyph. However, after 512 glyphs have been created, the generator will shut itself off forever and the glyphs will only be available on the secondary market." - from [developer website](https://www.larvalabs.com/autoglyphs)

## Art blocks
Significance: Platform for generative art  
Editions: Typically around 1000  
"Art Blocks is a generative art platform that allows collectors to mint tokens without knowing what they will get ahead of time. The artist writes a code that is plugged into the platform, which will generate different combinations of the variables at random. The creator, Snowfro, came up with the idea when he was claiming CryptoPunks back in 2017, and he thought it was unfair that he got to claim a bunch of zombies. Over the next few years, he sold over 20 zombies to fund the development of Art Blocks." - from [Meet Art Blocks: One of the Most Unique Platforms in NFTs Right Now](https://www.one37pm.com/nft/art/art-blocks-nft-platform-to-know)

A platform where the script to generate the art lives on the blockchain and where the parameters are determined when buyer initiates purchase.

## Deafbeaf
Significance: Audio focused generative art  
Editions: From 128 to 8 depending on series 
"Synth Poems are short generative music pieces, inspired by the sound of analog synthesizers. They are stored on-chain.
Each piece is generated at the time of minting from a random hash value, influencing musical elements including tempo, timbre, pitch and time signature. Simples rules lead to surprising variation, giving each piece it's own distinctive personality, while retaining a common theme.

Although synth poems are audio focused, a fitting visualization is added as an ode to early computer graphics that used vector displays to visualize analog signals. What you see is a direct representation of the sound signal, as it would appear on an oscilloscope." - from [artist's website](https://deafbeef.com/series/0)

Example works: 

- [Series 3: Entropy - Token 145](https://deafbeef.com/item/144)

- [Series 4: Glitchbox - Token 208](https://deafbeef.com/item/208)

Series 3 degrades in quality if it is transfered and series 4 allow the owner to experiment with parameters and change the art on the blockchain
