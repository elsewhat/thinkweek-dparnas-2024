# Metaverse worlds
There is a lot of momentum behind the metaverse, a collective virtual space not controlled by any one actor. 
There many players in the space, for example it's expected Epic Games will make an announcement relatively soon as [they have secured $1 billion dollars of funding recently](https://epicgames.com/site/th/news/announcing-a-1-billion-funding-round-to-support-epics-long-term-vision-for-the-metaverse)

Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney elaborates what metaverse means for them.

Blockchain technology allowing avatars and assets to be moved between worlds and traded is very likely to happen (though perhaps not directly on the Etherum blockchain)

## The Sandbox
"The Sandbox is a decentralised, community-driven gaming ecosystem where creators can share and monetise voxel assets and gaming experiences on the Ethereum blockchain.
Using The Sandbox's free software, such as VoxEdit and the Game Maker, players can create ASSETs and games for themselves and to share with others. These can be monetised to earn the creator passive income." - from [project's website](https://sandboxgame.gitbook.io/the-sandbox/)

## Decentraland
"Decentraland is a decentralized virtual reality platform powered by the Ethereum blockchain. Within the Decentraland platform, users can create, experience, and monetize their content and applications.

Enter and explore decentraland

The finite, traversable, 3D virtual space within Decentraland is called LAND, a non-fungible digital asset maintained in an Ethereum smart contract. Land is divided into parcels that are identified by cartesian coordinates (x,y). These parcels are permanently owned by members of the community and are purchased using MANA, Decentralandâ€™s cryptocurrency token. This gives users full control over the environments and applications that they create, which can range from anything like static 3D scenes to more interactive applications or games." - from [projects website](https://docs.decentraland.org/decentraland/introduction/)

## Cryptovoxels
"Cryptovoxels is a virtual world built on the ethereum block chain. The world consists of a city called Origin City, which has streets, that are owned by The Corporation, and parcels, that are owned by individual people. If you have an ethereum wallet, you can buy a parcel." - from [project's website](https://www.cryptovoxels.com/about)
