# Release strategy
Have a predicatable process around release and ensure API consumer are aware of it. 
Having a fixed release schedule for new functionality every two weeks or every month can provide a more predictable planning for the API consumers. 
A fixed release schedule will likely ease frictions when several API consumer have different prioritize on what should be delivered first. 

## Release epic
Plan releases so that there is a main focus for the release. This can for example be several endpoints for a new resource or supporting a new use case from start to finish. 

## Bugfixes
Fix bugs as quickly as possible if they are important for API consumers. If there is a bug identified in the morning, ideally it should be fixed by lunch. 
If this is possible, work with the API consumers to find a suitable workround.
