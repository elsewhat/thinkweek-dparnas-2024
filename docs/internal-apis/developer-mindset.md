# Developer mindset
It's important to know that you don't do marketing to developers. 

The focus must be on: 

1. Describing the business context for your API
1. Provide the details to get started
1. Provide the specification for the API contract
1. Operational aspects such as uptime monitoring, error logs, usage logs and alert systems
1. Facilitate a community including the developers consuming the API, the team responsible for DevOps and their product owners
1. Feature request process
1. Transparency on product backlog items for future releases
1. Release notes for updates
