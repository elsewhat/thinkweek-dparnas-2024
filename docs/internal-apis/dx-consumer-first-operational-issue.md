# First operational issue
Operational issue will happen before or later. One of the first actions of the API consumer is to identify the root cause. 

## Operational monitoring
API consumers should be able to access status pr API on uptime. This should automatically be updated based on health checks running continously. 

## Low bar for reaching out
Provide a slack channel for your API, where API producers can inform of downtime and the actions being taken to recover operational status.

## Post mortem
After any significant downtime, the API producers should supply the API consumers on a post mortem report on the root cause for the downtime and mitigating actions taken in order to reduce the likelihood of similar issues in the future.
