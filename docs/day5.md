# Day 1 - 4.4

## Topic of toyday - Internal APIs and developer portals
Getting ideas down to paper and focusing on completing the topic has been the focus for today.
Parts of this felt like writing down things I already, but for other parts it was a nice way of structuring my thoughts.

## Time schedule
A bit shorter day as I'm not spending the night in the cabin. 

Have not seen Albert today :(
