# Day 5 - 26.07

## Topic of today
The wrap-up day can be a bit challenging. I feel obligated to focus on writing to get key findings down, but I'd rather focus on practical experiements.

However, when writing down key findings, new thoughts pop-up which wouldn't be there if you hadn't forced it.

The week has been productive and I've attainted lots of new knowledge. 

This time I believe I have been better at finding a suistainable pace. Taking breaks when needed, listening to podcast in order to reduce isolation, going on hikes when the brain is overloaded. 

All in all, it's been a great experience I hope to be able to do again soon.
