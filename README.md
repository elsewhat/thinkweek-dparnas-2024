# Thinkweek 2021 for Dagfinn Parnas
For 2021, I will set aside a Think Week in order to reflect and deep dive into work topics important for me personally. 
I prioritize this instead of participating in conferences or attending courses.

See [https://elsewhat.com/thinkweek-dparnas-2021](https://elsewhat.com/thinkweek-dparnas-2021) for output of the thinkweek
